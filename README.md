## Description

We were given the task to clean up the HTML file for a website. No changes should be seen on the website- only fixes to the non-working link. I used google/help from my tutor to find the Sematic Elements information of the basic layout in HTML. My goal was to replace as many <div> tags with a more appropriate category - i.e. <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>. I also condensed some of the repetative atributes in the CSS syle sheet.
